Problem statement

Balanced parenthesis is recursively defined as:

1. Empty string is defined as balanced.

2. If S is balanced, then so is '(' + S + ')', where + denotes concatenation.

3. If S1 and S2 are balanced then so, S1+S2, where + denotes concatenation.



You are given a sequence S of length N of characters '(' and ')'. You have to delete exactly one character from S, such that after the deletion S is a balanced parenthesis sequence. You have to tell if it is possible or not to do so.



Input

First line contains T, the number of test cases. 

Each test case consists of string S in one line.



Output

For each test case, output "YES"(quotes for clarity) if we can delete exactly one character to make S balanced parenthesis sequence, else output "NO"(quotes for clarity).



Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10



Subtasks

1. 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (50% score)

2. 2 ≤ N ≤ 100000 (50%score)



Explanation

For first sample test case, we can remove third character to get a balanced parenthesis.

While in second sample test case, deleting any character will lead to an unbalanced parenthesis.


Sample testcases

Input

2 
()) 
()

Output

YES 
NO

Find minimum number of edits to balance parentheses.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29687542/find-the-minimum-number-of-edits-to-balance-parentheses

My approach:
            * find final string having left over open and close brackets which couldn't make pair. 
            Remember that in this final string, close brackets will be present 1st and then open brackets.
            * Now we will have to edit open brackets and close brackets separately.
            * eg: for close brackets: 
                (1) if it is of even length:
                    min edit to balance will be to change half close brackets to open brackets. So minEdit = closeBracketCount/2
                (2) If it is of odd length:
                    min edit to balance will be to do above step 1 and remove the remaining 1 bracket. so minEdit = closeBracketCount/2 + 1

            * eg: for open brackets: 
                (1) if it is of even length:
                    min edit to balance will be to change half open brackets to close brackets. So minEdit = openBracketCount/2
                (2) If it is of odd length:
                    min edit to balance will be to do above step 1 and remove the remaining 1 bracket. so minEdit = openBracketCount/2 + 1
